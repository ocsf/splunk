# Splunk OCSF Extension
This is the Splunk schema extension repository.

This extension is designed to work with the [OCSF schema](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema) version [1.0.0-rc.2](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/tree/v1.0.0-rc.2). The extension some adds fields specific to Splunk's internal usage, plus back-ports of a number of changes from later versions of the schema to work with `1.0.0-rc.2`.
